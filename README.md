# Hello there.

My name is Ana and I’m a junior full stack web developer, specialising in backend. I’m a Makers Academy alumna and former staff member, with a diverse working experience under my belt.
I’m looking for my first full-time developer role in an agile development team that helps junior developers to grow their skills.

## Skills

#### Adaptable and flexible

The UK is the 5th country I’ve worked in, therefore I have experienced an interesting range of work cultures, with people from all sorts of walks of life. I’ve been told I’m quite the peacemaker and I work well with most people and in most circumstances.

#### Attention to detail

My experience in photography and digitisation gave me an acute eye for detail. This comes handy when I’m writing code, especially when I’m debugging a problem.

#### Inquisitive

There aren’t many things that I find boring. I don’t shy away from learning new things and taking on new experiences and challenges. This has proved invaluable during my time working and studying at Makers Academy

## Experience

**Makers Academy** (Nov 2015 - Jun 2017)    
*Coach/Junior Developer*    

I always wanted to learn to code, so Makers Academy gave me the opportunity to do their web development course while I was working there. After successfully completing it, I rejoined the team and moved to a different role. My main responsibilities included:
- Supporting the students during their 4-week PreCourse
- Further developing and maintaining the PreCourse curriculum
- Interviewing and selecting student applicants
- Supporting the Sales and Marketing team in their technical needs, by automating processes and supporting the development of more efficient ones (e.g. using Twitter API to gather data; setting up A/B tests; pulling data from website forms into PipeDrive and customer.io)
- Providing ad-hoc development in the company’s internal software applications and website (e.g. updating a Sinatra application using data from Github and Codewars APIs; fixing bugs; general website maintenance)

**Makers Academy** (Mar 2013 - Aug 2015)   
*Office Manager/Operations*   

I was Makers Academy’s first hire, when it a was a brand-new startup in a run-down office building in Old Street. I had a chance to work in a variety of areas, in a very fast-paced work environment, that included:
- Developing and/or maintaining processes for different areas of the business (bookkeeping, students admissions, HR, operations), which involved building several spreadsheets that
- Setting up MacBooks for students
- Writing the company’s quarterly newsletter
- Liaising with suppliers (e.g. cleaners, catering, security, etc)
- Sourcing IT and other office equipment
Some projects that I’m proud of:
  - Coordinating a office move on a very tight schedule and limited resources, with barely any downtime.
  - A successful Visa sponsorship licence application with the Home Office
  - A successful Consumer Credit Licence application with the FCA

**FamilySearch** (May 2011 - Oct 2012)    
*Archival Digitisation*  

- Digitising documents for the world’s largest collection of free family trees, genealogy records and resources.
- Handling large amounts of digital imagery, including capturing, naming and filing.
- Project management tasks such as setting working goals for teams, monitoring and reporting progress, planning training sessions.
